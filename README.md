# givehub

## Project scope
Givehub aims to be a centralised platform for Singaporeans to discover low-tech charities, follow causes they support, and manage their donations, all in hopes of cultivating social responsibility within the community.


## Problem motivation
According to a 2020 [ipsos.com/en-sg/what-worries-singaporeans-inequality-and-playing-part-policy-development](survey) conducted by Ipsos, poverty and social inequality is the third biggest concern for Singaporeans (33%), falling just behind unemployment (48%) and healthcare (42%), which are naturally on top given the current health crisis. This has led to the burgeoning of charitable initiatives within the community. However, many of these charities have yet to effectively digitalise or lack an online presence. And with the coronavirus pandemic, the need for charities to adopt technology to raise awareness and funds has become more urgent than ever. 


While government website [giving.sg](giving.sg) gives these charities an online shopfront to receive donations, the website does not do much to “market” these charities, and while these charities can set up Facebook pages, the platform does not do much to enable the discovery of such up-and-coming causes, not to mention the fact that their presence will inevitably be diluted by the bigger sea of non-charity pages. 


To solve such problems within the local charity scene, we came up with Givehub, which aims to be a centralised platform for Singaporeans to discover low-tech charities and follow causes they support, as well as for local charities to manage their funding. With these three objectives, we hope to ultimately cultivate social responsibility and address the major concern among Singaporeans that is social inequality.
